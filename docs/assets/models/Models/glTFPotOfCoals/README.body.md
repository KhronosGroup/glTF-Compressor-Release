## Description

This asset represents a copper pot using emissive for glowing hot coals, coated with a clearcoat layer on the exterior, and including the glTF and Khronos Group and DGG logos. 

The textures are compressed with JPEG to reduce file size, but the normal bump texture for the copper pot has been kept in PNG format to preserve the emboss details around the logos.

## Animated Version

The asset in the `glTF-Animation` folder adds an animated heat-refraction effect on top of the emissive coals. A rotating disc has been added, using the extensions KHR_materials_specular, KHR_materials_transmission, and KHR_materials_volume.
